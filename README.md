# pi-squared-over-6
Calculating pi based on the famous sum

oo<br />
&sum;<i>1/n<sup>2</sup></i> = &Pi;<sup>2</sup>/6;<br />
<i>n=1</i>

To run:

no libraries required, this uses just pure python. Simply download the file and run:

`python(3) calc.py`

The C version of the program is of course, much faster than the python one. For now, download the file and change the value inside the calculate_pi function to specify how
many numbers you want to calculate. Then you can run the code in either an online compiler or download something like GCC or clang to compile and run the file...
